      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>We are a passionate and dedicated group of volunteers in New York City, the Pacific Northwest, and LA. We work in partnership with local and regional South Korean dog rescuers/activist and high kill shelters. Many of our dogs come from the brutal dog meat trade and are also puppy mill survivors. These two billion dollar industries work hand in hand with each other. We bring them for adoption to the US because they have a very low chance of ever finding homes in their homeland because of the “stigma” associated with unwanted dogs.</p>

        <p>We are also working to end the dog meat trade in Korea where over 2.5 million dogs a year are tortured and slaughtered for consumption because of the belief that tortured dog meat gives medicinal benefits. Our #BanDogMeat Movement is creating awareness and pressure on the South Korean government to put an end to this brutal trade.</p>

        <p>We stand with the animal activist and rescuers in Korea. A portion of the adoption fee goes back to these groups in Korea. Please send us a message via the contact page for more information and follow us on <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/KoreanK9Rescue/" target="_blank" id="facebook">Facebook</a></b></p>

            Gina started rescuing dogs and cats locally in 2012 and has since re-homed thousands of homeless dogs throughout New York City by working with a large private Brooklyn no-kill animal shelter. She is always on call for animal emergencies. Born in South Korea, Gina came to the US at a young age and learned about the plight of the Korean dog meat trade several years ago. Armed with a background in animal rescue and activism she founded Korean K9 Rescue and is working to end the dog meat trade in Korea with the partnership of many local and regional Korean activist and rescuers. Gina believes together we can change values through acts of compassion, not necessarily just words.

            Hannah’s passion for dog psychology began in 2009 when she adopted her first beloved dog, Lucas. Her dedication to rehabilitate Lucas into a well-behaved companion inspired the founding of her own company, The Fit Pup, where the goal is to “master the walk.” With more than seven years of experience working with dogs and owners from all walks of life, Hannah is in her element when it comes to pack walks. She has trained with renowned dog behaviorists like Cheri Lucas and Brian Agnew, and continues to advance her education on the latest training techniques in dog psychology. In short, Hannah is Korean K9 Rescue’s very own “dog whisperer.”
